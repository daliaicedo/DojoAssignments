# Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use an array to do this exercise.

# count = 1
# while count <= 1000:
#     print count,
#     count+=2
#
# count = 1
# for count in range (1,1000,2):
#   print count,
#

# Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

# count =  5
# for count in range(5,1000000,5):
#     print count


# Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# b = sum(a)
# print b

# Create a program that prints the average of the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# b = sum(a)
# print b
# c = b / len(a)
# print c
